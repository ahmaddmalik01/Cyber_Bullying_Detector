The "Cyber Bullying Detector on Twitter (X)" project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) to identify and mitigate instances of cyberbullying on the Twitter (X) platform. The system processes tweets in real-time, analyzing text content to detect harmful language patterns and flagging potential cyberbullying cases. It utilizes advanced NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and text classification, combined with ML algorithms to continuously improve detection accuracy. This project aims to contribute to online safety by providing an effective tool for monitoring and addressing cyberbullying on social media.
